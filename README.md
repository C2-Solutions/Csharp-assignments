# C# Assignments

This is the master branch for our C# assignments.

Our group was a little too big for Karim's tastes,
so it had to be split up into two smaller groups.
The current groups are as follows:

| Team   | Members              | Branch                                                                                            | Notes                                         |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Main   | None                 |                                                                                                   |                                               |
| Coop   | All                  | [Coop](https://github.com/C2-Solutions/Csharp-assignments/tree/Coop)                              | Assignments for the entire group              |
| Team 1 | Joosd, Remco, Ronan  | [Joosd-Remco-Ronan](https://github.com/C2-Solutions/Csharp-assignments/tree/Joosd-Remco-Ronan)    |                                               |
| Team 2 | Michael, Enno, Bryan | [Michael-Enno-Bryan](https://github.com/C2-Solutions/Csharp-assignments/tree/Michael-Enno-Bryan)  |                                               |

There are some assignments we're supposed to finish as a full group.
For those cases, the branch `Coop` has been created.

Hopefully this setup makes it easier for us to share code and ideas without resorting to multiple repositories.
