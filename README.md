# C# Assignments

This is the master branch.

Our group was a little too big for Karim's tastes,
so it had to be split up into two smaller groups.
They are as follows:

| Team   | Members              | Branch                | Notes                                         |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Main   | None                 |                       |                                               |
| Coop   | All                  | Coop                  | Assignments for the entire group              |
| Team 1 | Joosd, Remco, Ronan  | Joosd-Remco-Ronan     |                                               |
| Team 2 | Michael, Enno, Bryan | Michael-Enno-Bryan    |                                               |

There are some assignments we're supposed to finish as a full group.
For those cases, the branch `Coop` has been created.

Hopefully this setup makes it easier for us to share codes and ideas without resorting to multiple repositories.
